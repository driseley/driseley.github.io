 I started karate in the 1980s, training in Wado-Ryu at Cranleigh Karate Club under Sensei Gary Swift. Karate was a huge part of my life as a child, and I trained 4 times a week, helping out with teaching as I got older. I was preparing for my Shodan grading and then college got in the way, and I stopped training at around 16. 

I missed karate and trained with various Wado clubs around London in my twenties but didn’t stick with any of them. Then I had a longer break from karate until January 2020, when I switched to Shotokan and joined SKIF. I only had 3 months of in-person training before lockdown, but trained on Zoom with Sensei Clive throughout that time. 

In February 2022 I graded to Shodan, and Nidan in July 2024.

I started training in Shotokan Karate in 1987, under Sensei Jujhar Gill in Hounslow, West London. I gained my 1st Dan in 1994 and 2nd Dan in 1996, and competed in several kata and kumite tournaments around the UK, including representing Hounslow borough at the London Youth Games in 1994, ‘95 and ‘96. I began training as a coach and in 1999 qualified as a FEKO national tournament referee and judge. I then stopped training as I moved away to begin a career in science and engineering.

A temporary pause became 20+ years away, but I eventually returned to training at the Heiwa club in Surrey, encouraged by my son’s progress through the grades. Having re-discovered some long-dormant skills, I was registered as a 1st Dan within SKKIF in March 2024, and in March 2025 was graded to 2nd Dan by Kyoshi Roger Carpenter.
