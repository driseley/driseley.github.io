We run classes on Tuesdays and Sundays. Brown belts come to the 6.30pm class and stay for an extra lesson afterwards.

Our Sunday sessions are for brown belts and black belts. Everyone has a say in what we will cover in a session. 

We train at Milford School, Church Road, Milford GU8 5JA.

Everyone is welcome at Heiwa regardless of experience. We also cater for people with additional needs. If you would like a free trial, email us at <info@heiwa.org.uk>.
