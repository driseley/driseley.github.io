We set up Heiwa Milford in January 2024, with years of karate experience at different clubs between us. 

We run the club as a non-profit. This means that training fees only go towards hall hire and back into the club itself. 

So far, we have subsidised a children's tournament and bought new equipment for the club, including: 

- mitts for sparring
- focus mitts and kick shields for target practice
- floor mats
- break boards
